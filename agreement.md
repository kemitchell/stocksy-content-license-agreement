## Ownership and Limited Transfer

Each Member retains all rights to their Content, including copyright, title, and all other intellectual property rights. The Client agrees that, except for the rights expressly granted by Stocksy under this Agreement, no rights in any Content are granted to the Client at any time.

Stocksy agrees to a limited transfer of granted rights between a Client authorized to purchase on behalf of another or between a Client and a third party, where the third party is integral to the creation of the final Work (for example, a printer, designer, or social media manager), provided those parties agree to the terms of this Agreement. If you have questions about whether an intended transfer falls within this limited right, please contact support@stocksy.com

## Grant of Sublicense

### Standard License

Subject to all terms of this Agreement, Stocksy grants the Client a **perpetual**, **worldwide**, **non-exclusive**, **non-transferable**, and **non-sublicensable** license in the Content; and the Client may use the Content in the creation of Works and modify, reproduce, transmit, or display the Content.

Without the purchase of an Extended License (Multi-Seat, Product for Resale, and/or Unlimited Print) or written permission from Stocksy, the Client may not allow the Content to be accessed by more than one user, use Content in a template or on-demand product, or for any other use not expressly granted in this section. For questions regarding use of Content or to clarify use details, Stocksy encourages Client to contact support@stocksy.com.

The Standard License allows use in:

- **advertising, editorial, and promotional projects, up to 500,000 hard copies**. This includes but is not limited to promotional materials, product packaging, book covers, presentations, catalogues, magazines, or newspapers;

- **online, electronic, and mobile publications and applications for an unlimited number of impressions**. This includes but is not limited to websites, e-book covers, online album or playlist covers, broadcast media, and mobile application or video game backgrounds or elements where the content is not contributing to the core value; or

- **any social media platform**, but where no modification is made to the photograph or video, an attribution must accompany the social media post with specific mention of the original Artist's name and Stocksy United. Stocksy asks that you consider properly embedding Content or limiting the filesize of Content posted to social media as a best practice to protect the artist's copyright.

### Multi-Seat License
Allows for any number of users within the same organization to use the Content, so long as all users agree to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement, and that the Client remains liable for all use by additional users. This license is required for any Content that will be stored on a server or content management system for simultaneous or team access. Use by global offices, non-branded affiliates, and non-direct subsidiaries is not included in the Multi-Seat License.

Client acknowledges and agrees that there will be no restriction on the grant of any license or other right to the Content before or after the Market Freeze Period, and previous licensees of the Content will have the right to continue using the Content during the Market Freeze Period. Client may continue non-exclusive use of Content in perpetuity. Purchase of this license includes the following complimentary Extended Licenses: Multi-Seat, Unlimited Print, and Products for Resale (excluding 3 month Market Freeze licenses).
